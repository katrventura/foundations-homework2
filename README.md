# foundations-homework2
Note to reader:
There is no homework 1. Homework 2 really is the first coding assignment we had to work on in Python. I had no prior experience in programming when I did this on Visual Code and so I worked on the problem set in the simplest way I can and used the code that made the most sense to me. However, I am proud to say that while much of this is not how a programmer would have written, it does in fact run on Python.
